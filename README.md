# Self-driving Cars Nanodegree

This repository contains all the projects I made for the self-driving cars nanodegree by Udacity

## Finding Lane lines

Extract the lane lines from a picture and highlight them on the road

![Project 1][project1]

## Traffic sign recognition

Train a deep learning neural network to identify a traffic sign image

|Speed limit : 120 km/h|![project2_image1][project2_image1]|
|No passing            |![project2_image2][project2_image2]|
|Priority road         |![project2_image3][project2_image3]|
|General caution       |![project2_image4][project2_image4]|
|Slippery road         |![project2_image5][project2_image5]|

## Behavioral cloning

Train a deep learning neural network to mimic the control of a car in a simulator

![Project 3][project3]

## Advanced lane finding

Use advanced computer vision technics to identify lane on an image

![Project 4][project4]

## Vehicle detection

Use advanced computer vision technics to identify vehicle on an image

(soon...)
