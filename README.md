# Self-driving Cars Nanodegree

This repository contains all the projects I made for the self-driving cars nanodegree by Udacity

## Finding Lane lines

Extract the lane lines from a picture and highlight them on the road

![Project 1][project1]

## Traffic sign recognition

Train a deep learning neural network to identify a traffic sign image
